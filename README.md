- **Create New Characters**: Generate configuration files for new characters by copying from existing ones
- **Selective Copying**: Choose which file types to copy (UI, Config, Spellsets) with checkboxes
- **Export to ZIP**: Export selected characters with selected file types to a ZIP archive
- **Modern UI**: Built with CustomTkinter for a clean, modern dark theme interface

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Executable (Recommended - No Python Required!)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/stephenjarrett/quarm-quick-character-copy/releases) page
2. Download `QuarmQuickCharacterCopy.exe` from the latest release
3. Run the executable - no Python installation required!

### Option 2: Run from Source

**If you don't have Python installed**, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
   - **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or if `python` doesn't work, try:
   ```bash
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The app will open in a desktop window.

2. **Set Directory**: Click "Browse" to select your Project Quarm directory (default: `C:\Games\Project Quarm`), or type it manually. The app will automatically scan when you press Enter or click away.

3. **Copy Configuration** (Copy Configuration tab):
   - Select a source character from the "From Character" dropdown
   - Either select a target character from "To Character" dropdown OR enter a new character name
   - Check/uncheck which file types to copy (UI, Config File (Friends/Ignored/Ability bars), Spellsets)
   - Click "Copy Configuration"

4. **Export Characters** (Export Characters tab):
   - Select characters using the checkboxes (or use "Select All"/"Deselect All")
   - Choose which file types to export
   - Click "Export Selected to ZIP"
   - Choose where to save the ZIP file

## File Types

- **UI File**: `UI_{CharacterName}_pq.proj.ini` - User interface layout and settings
- **Config File**: `{CharacterName}_pq.proj.ini` - Character configuration
- **Spellsets**: `{CharacterName}_spellsets.ini` - Spell set configurations

## Notes

- The application saves your Project Quarm directory in `config.json` for convenience
- When creating a new character, files are generated by copying from the source character
- When copying to an existing character, existing files will be overwritten (you'll be prompted to confirm)
- All file operations preserve the original file timestamps and metadata
- The app uses CustomTkinter for a modern dark theme desktop interface

## Building the Executable

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed instructions on building the executable, including automated builds via GitHub Actions.

## Technology

Built with Python and CustomTkinter for a modern, cross-platform GUI experience. CustomTkinter provides a beautiful dark theme and modern UI components while maintaining ease of use.
